# Sales_Analysis_for_an_Automobile_Company_USA
A Data Science Project that Analysed  the sales performance of an Automobile company Based in the United States. The companyâ€™s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for a Bike Product Category in the United States ?

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING
#  importing all the necessary python packages 
#### DATA LOADING
```Python
#solution
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print ("The packages have been successfully imported")
```
# reading the sales Data into a pandas dataframe
```Python
bikes_df=pd.read_csv("D:/DATA SCIENCE CLASS/_EXCLUSIVE DATA SCIENCE BOOT CAMP_STUDENT FOLDER/_DATASET/bikes.csv")
bikes_df.head()
```
## DATA MODIFICATION
```Python

# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pandas Dataframe:  bikes_df


# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]

bikes_df.head()
```
## DATA ANALYSIS

### DATA FILTERING
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement  
```Python
is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"]== "United States"
is_bike= bikes_df["ProductCategory"]== "Bikes"

bike_in_the_US =bikes_df[(is_usa) & (is_bike)]
bike_in_the_US.head()
```
#### DATA AGGREGATION
# aggreegating the total profit by states in the United States for bike Sales.
```Python
total_profit_by_state = bike_in_the_US.pivot_table(values="Profit",index="CustomerState",aggfunc=np.sum)
total_profit_by_state
```
#### DATA SORTING
# Sorting the Aggregated Data in order to Rank the state according to the top most profitable state
```Python
total_profit_by_state.sort_values("Profit",ascending=False)
```
## RESULTS
#Top Most-Profitable 5 States for a Bike Product Category in the United States
```Python
Top_5_most_profitable_state_USA = total_profit_by_state.sort_values("Profit",ascending=False).head()
Top_5_most_profitable_state_USA
```
## DATA VISUALIZATION
# Visualizing the Result
```Python

Top_5_most_profitable_state_USA.plot(kind="bar")

#add a title and label to the plot
plt.title("The Top 5 Most Profitable for Bike Product in the USA")

plt.ylabel("Total profit in Million Dollars")
plt.xlabel("States")

#showing the plot
plt.show()
```
